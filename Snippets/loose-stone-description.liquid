<p>The most practical gemâ€”ever. Our Moissanites are a colorless icy white that 
  produce the most brilliant shine and sparkle. This gem is commonly mistaken for its 
  over-marketed counterpart with its strikingly similar visual qualities - even professional 
  jewelers admit they have difficulty telling the two gemstones apart. </p>
