                  Moissanite is composed of silicon carbide and is a rare mineral that originates from space meteorites. 
                  Moissanites were first discovered by chemist Dr. Henri Moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike 
                  in Arizona, USA. This new stone was named 'Moissanite' in his 
                  honor as Dr. Moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate 
                  this rare mineral in his laboratory.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until the late 80's 
                   where scientists developed the innovative 
                  thermal growing process that made Moissanites more widely available to consumers.

                  Moissanite is not a Diamond or substitute of a Diamond, either scientifically, chemically or emotionally. Moissanite is not a fake Diamond but rather a different type of clear gemstone (just like White Sapphires) with its own set of chemical and optical properties.

                  Carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a Diamond's weight. Moissanites are not measured in carats because it weighs approximately 10 percent less than diamond. For example, a 6.5mm round diamond would weigh 1.0ct, while a 6.5mm round moissanite would weigh 0.88ct. The two stones would visually be the same size - 6.5mm in diameter. All stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight (DEW) in carats.

                  There are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite (or any other gemstone) will be permanently changed. Moissanites experience a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jeweler's torch during jewelry repair, but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage, and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools.

                  Moissanite can have needle-like inclusions that can be seen under 10x magnification. However, they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone. It's worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion. They are unique characteristics, which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure.

                  The most significant optical property affecting a gemstone's brilliance, or sparkle, is the refractive index or RI. The RI of moissanite ranges from 2.65 to 2.69, meaning it displays more brilliance than diamond (with an RI of 2.42) or any other popular gemstone.

                  A gemstone's fire is determined by a gemological property called dispersion. Dispersion refers to the prism effect that occurs when pure white light enters a non-opaque object, breaks into spectral (rainbow) colors, and reflects back to the viewer. Moissanite's dispersion is 0.104, which exceeds that of any gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald.

                  Moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones, including diamond. Tests prove that at 2000ºF - higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire - moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created. This heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair.

                <p>Under laboratory conditions and computers control temperatures, 
                  foreign materials found in the earth are eliminated from our starting 
                  chemicals. This makes lab grown gems more predictable and consistent. 
                  Only the best qualities and colors make it to the retail market.
                  Lower qualities will not make it past quality control and are not released for sale.

              <p>
                No. All gemstones are grown in a lab under a controlled 
                environment producing the most purest color possible. 
                The chemical structure and coloring agents are equivalent to its mined counterparts.

            </a>
            <div class="js-about-content about-content hidden">
              <p>Yes. In fact, lab created stones are more durable 
                because they have fewer inclusions than most of their mined counterparts.
                For lab grown gems, 80% of the rough parts are cut away to deliver near a “flawless” 
                piece. The hardness of lab created stones are exactly the same as their mined counterparts. 
                In addition, a Lifetime Warranty is offered to back our promise of quality, 
                which is something uncommon for any mined gemstone.
