            <p>
              Moissanite is composed of silicon carbide and is a rare mineral that originates from space meteorites. 
              Moissanites were first discovered by chemist Dr. Henri Moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike 
              in Arizona, USA. This new stone was named 'Moissanite' in his 
              honor as Dr. Moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate 
              this rare mineral in his laboratory.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until the late 80's 
               where scientists developed the innovative 
              thermal growing process that made Moissanites more widely available to consumers.

            <p>
              Moissanite is not a Diamond or substitute of a Diamond, either scientifically, chemically or emotionally. Moissanite is not a fake Diamond but rather a different type of clear gemstone (just like White Sapphires) with its own set of chemical and optical properties.

          <div class="js-about-content about-content hidden">
            <p>
              Carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a Diamond's weight. Moissanites are not measured in carats because it weighs approximately 10 percent less than diamond. For example, a 6.5mm round diamond would weigh 1.0ct, while a 6.5mm round moissanite would weigh 0.88ct. The two stones would visually be the same size - 6.5mm in diameter. All stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight (DEW) in carats.

            <p>
              There are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite (or any other gemstone) will be permanently changed. Moissanites experience a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jeweler's torch during jewelry repair, but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage, and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools.

              Moissanite can have needle-like inclusions that can be seen under 10x magnification. However, they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone. It's worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion. They are unique characteristics, which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure.

              The most significant optical property affecting a gemstone's brilliance, or sparkle, is the refractive index or RI. The RI of moissanite ranges from 2.65 to 2.69, meaning it displays more brilliance than diamond (with an RI of 2.42) or any other popular gemstone.

            <p>
              A gemstone's fire is determined by a gemological property called dispersion. Dispersion refers to the prism effect that occurs when pure white light enters a non-opaque object, breaks into spectral (rainbow) colors, and reflects back to the viewer. Moissanite's dispersion is 0.104, which exceeds that of any gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald.

              Moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones, including diamond. Tests prove that at 2000ÂºF - higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire - moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created. This heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair.

              You may clean moissanite the same way you would diamond or any other fine gemstone. As with any fine jewelry item, an ultrasonic cleaner can be used. However, it is best to be gentle with your valuable treasures. You can also clean your moissanite jewelry using a commercial (non-acid based) jewelry cleaner or with mild soap and water using a soft toothbrush.
