          If you will not be home to sign for your order, Gema&Co can ship your order to your 
          place of work, or another more convenient destination. As a security precaution to 
          protect our customers against fraud, when you order merchandise priced $1000 or more 
          to be delivered to a destination other than your billing address, we will confirm 
          that your credit card or financing company has this alternate shipping address on 
          file. To help expedite your order, simply call your issuing bank and provide them 
          with your alternate shipping address.
